<h3>DPS Code Changes and Update (08/12/09)

<p>In April DPS upgraded their system and implemented several changes. One of those changes was the addition and removal of several DPS Offense codes. Below is a list of codes that were removed and those that were added. Most notably is the removal of all 4000 level codes. DPS will not accept all Non-Traffic Violations as code 3999. This code, 3999, can ONLY be used for the FTA program and cannot be used with any of the other DPS programs. The current list of DPS codes can be found by clicking on Support/Help then DPS Codes.

  RES DPS Code File Update and Download (08/12/09)

</h3>
<p>To ensure that the RES software will accept the new DPS codes, each court will need to download the DPS Code file. Please exit out of the RES program before starting download. To download the file, click on Downloads in the title bar and then click on DPS Codes – Updated 08/12/09. A window will appear and ask if you would like to open or save the file to your computer. Select 'Save' and place the file in the C:\CDSRES directory. It will ask you to overwrite existing file and select 'Yes'. That's it; the codes have been updated to your system. If you have any questions please contact technical support @ 1.800.686.0680.

<h3>Termination of DPS Warrant Database

</h3>
<p>The Director of the Department of Public Safety announced the termination of the DPS Warrant Database on March 26, 2004. The letter announcing the termination also referred to the Failure to Appear Program as an alternative for handling violators who fail to appear. The announcement has created a surge in interest for information on the FTA program.

  </p>
<p>The Failure to Appear Program had no connection with the former Warrant Database and relies on a different method to get violators before the court. The FTA program restricts the ability of a violator with any type of Texas driver license from renewing that license until the reported offense is resolved to the satisfaction of the reporting court. There is no potential for liability from an arrest as the statute provides immunity for use of the program to the jurisdiction. </p>
<p>In addition, the FTA program is much broader as any offense within the jurisdiction of the municipality or the county court may be entered into the program. This might include traffic violations, penal code violations, fish and wildlife violations, and city ordinance or county order violations. Finally, all fees for the FTA program are collected from the violator at the time of disposition and should be at no cost to the jurisdiction.

  </p>
<h3>FTA Program Expanded for Counties

</h3>
<p>Effective June 18, 2003, the FTA Program was expanded for counties to now include all offenses within the jurisdiction of the county. The Legislature approved Senate Bill 782 which amended Chapter 706.002 of the Texas Transportation Code to permit any offense that a court has jurisdiction of under Chapter 4, Code of Criminal Procedure, to be added. This change did not effect justice or municipal courts but now permits other county criminal courts (including county cases in district court) to use the program. For example, more serious DWI, theft or worthless checks, drug offenses, assaults, and other criminal offenses can now be entered into the FTA program. Other provisions of the FTA program including the $30.00 administrative fee collected from the violator were not changed.  </p>
<p>Counties that are currently using the FTA program for the justice courts do not require a new contract with the State to begin the program. Upon completion and receipt of an Information Sheet, we will send our software and you may begin the program. If the county is not currently contracted with the State, it will require approval of the Interlocal Cooperation Contract with the State.

  If you need a copy of the contract, it is available on this web site. </p>
<p>If you need an Information Sheet or additional information, please contact us. </p>
